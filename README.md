Radiography Image Construction with Homogeneous Spheres

This project focuses on the construction of radiography images based on a diagram featuring homogenous spheres. The implementation involves applying the Beer-Lambert law, a fundamental principle in radiography.
Overview:

    Objective: Generate radiography images from a diagram containing homogenous spheres.
    Principle: Utilizes the Beer-Lambert law to model the attenuation of radiation through materials.

Key Features:

    Homogenous Spheres: The construction centers around homogenous spheres, ensuring a simplified yet illustrative representation.
    Beer-Lambert Law Implementation: The project implements the Beer-Lambert law to simulate the absorption of radiation, providing realistic radiography results.
